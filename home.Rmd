I am a biostatistician working at the intersection between stastistics, computational biology, genetics and agronomy. My research is focused on developing and applying statistical methods to broaden our understanding of processes and patterns in living organisms. Vital part of my work is to create, collaborate, and improve computational software. I also enjoy teaching and occasionally provide remote and in-person workshops and consulting services.
